# Hi, I'm Esteban Aleart! üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here you'll find an overview of my skills, experiences, and interests.

## About Me

I am a Full Stack Web Developer graduated from the SoyHenry bootcamp and currently pursuing a degree in Systems Engineering. I am passionate about turning what I learn into practical and impactful solutions.

My technical skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, Express, Sequelize, SQL, MongoDB, and tools like Axios, WebRTC, and Socket.io. I am experienced in building dynamic web applications, creating interactive dashboards, generating structured PDFs, and optimizing responsive user interfaces.

Before entering the tech world, I worked extensively in healthcare as a nurse and ambulance driver, which gave me a unique perspective, strong problem-solving skills, and the ability to work effectively under pressure. I also have experience in teaching and mentoring, sharing knowledge, and guiding others in their learning journey.
